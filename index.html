                        <p><div class="fonttest"><strong>Founded on June 15, 1985,</strong> </div> Studio Ghibli is headed by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Prior to the formation of the studio, Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on <em>Hols: Prince of the Sun</em> and <em>Panda! Go, Panda!</em>; and Suzuki was an editor at Tokuma Shoten's Animage manga magazine.</p>
                        
                        <p> Established after the success of the 1984 film <em> Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em>, the studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata (most notably with <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em>). Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondo, Hiroyuki Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films.</p>

                        <p> In October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo. It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short films not available elsewhere. The studio is known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad due to <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind</em> being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as Warriors of the Wind. The "no cuts" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing <em>Princess Mononoke</em> to make it more marketable. A Studio Ghibli producer is rumoured to have sent an authentic Japanese sword with a simple message: "No cuts".</p>

                        <p>The last film Hayao Miyazaki directed before retiring from feature films was <em>The Wind Rises</em>, which is about the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and its founder. On Sunday, September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice to confirm his retirement, saying: "I know I've said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, 'Once again.' But this time I am quite serious."</p>

                        <p>On August 3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take a "brief pause" to re-evaluate and restructure in the wake of Miyazaki's retirement. He stated some concerns about where the company would go in the future. This has led to speculation that Studio Ghibli will never produce another feature film again. On November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, "That was not my intention, though. All I did was announce that I would be retiring and not making any more features."</p>
